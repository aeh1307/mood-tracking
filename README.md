# mood-tracking

The app is part of a master thesis at the University of Bergen (UiB) in the institute of information and media science
and Centre for the Science of Learning & Technology (SLATE). The purpose of this project is to gain insight into how to best design a mental health app for
students, and investigate which attitudes students have towards usage of such apps.

This app was build as a start of the prototype of a mental health mood tracking app for students. 
The app was built in Vue.js using Nuxt.js for server side rendering, and Firebase for data storage. 
The app was at this stadium web based, in order to easily get access on both iOS and Android mobile phones in early testing.

It is important to note that the app has known bugs. These were dealt with, and the app was improved when 
intergrating it into an open soruce project lead by a Phd candidate at Bergen University College. 
To integrate the app in the open soruce project, it was rewritten in react native. 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
